	◼︎ FAQ 	:	{
					◼︎ What if my event gets cancelled (e.g. weather, illness, unavailability)
						: If Paisley is available for a later date she may be booked at the same rate as agreed upon before the cancellation, if a deposit was required in your contract that deposit may be applied to another event for up to one year. If Paisley becomes unavailable every effort will be made to provide the client with another artist, the price may be subject to change.
						Artist's may be booked, at the same rate for a future date if available

					◼︎ Latex allergies
						: If your latex allergy is contact only, we can put your balloon creation in a plastic bag to protect you. If it is more serious we can use foil balloons in many circumstances, but there are no latex free balloons that we can twist. Contact if you have more questions about the details of latex in our balloons.
					
					◼︎ Environmental issues
						: Paisley uses high quality balloons that are 100% latex and biodegrade almost as fast as a paper bag. When mylars or foil balloons are used they may be turned in at certain recycling centers. Our balloons do not contain helium. 

					◼︎ What does your pricing include
						: Paisley maintains full insurance coverage over all workers. She also attends classes and conferences to learn the best techniques and resources. We also use the highest quality products on the market. All of this adds up to piece of mind for you and the highest degree of professionalism we can provide. 

					◼︎ How long will my balloons last
						: Twisted animal balloons usually last through the party and paisley will replace them if she is able. Decorative balloons usually last for a few hours outside depending on weather conditions, and may last months inside depending on their treatment. We always recommend that you treat your balloons the way that you would treat flowers; they don't love extreme temperature or over-handling.

					◼︎ How long will glitter tattoos last
						: Our glitter tattoos are water proof and may last over a week if they're not scrubbed. If you want to take them off earlier it's best to use a makeup remover or oil based soap product. 

					◼︎ What about balloons and glitter tattoos for toddlers and babies
						: We do glitter tattoos on children as long as they are willing and do not require being restrained. We recommend 3 years and up but we do get requests for 1st year birthday parties. If a parent were to request a balloon for their young one we will make the balloon for the parent only and tell them that if they give it to their child that they should be under adult supervision at all times and keep it away from their face. We do not want your precious little one to choke on our products!

					◼︎ what if more kids show up than expected
						: If I am able to stay late I will offer you an overtime rate based on every 15 minutes extra. If I was hired for a per child rate I will offer you the same rate as previously agreed upon in addition to the original contract. 

					◼︎ Will Paisley be in clown attire
						: Paisley typically does not perform in a clown costume or makeup. She does wear cute professional attire. If you wish for her to be a clown that typically includes a 50$ charge per event.

					◼︎ How do you accept payments or tips (e.g. cards, cash, checks, electronic)
						: Cash or check are always accepts. Checks should be made to Liz Voss. Credit Cards are accepted via Square. Electronic payments are accepted through Square, Paypal, Venmo, Zelle, and ApplePay. Tips are appreciated at many of our events unless otherwise noted. 

					◼︎ Does anything have to be provided on the clients
						: Generally Paisley brings her own table and signage. If the weather is over 85º a tent or shaded area is necessary to keep the balloons from popping. Paisley may bring her own tent for a small fee. If you have any additional tables or chairs that would save us time setting up and be a huge help on your end. 

					◼︎ Does Paisley you do volunteer or charity work
						: Paisley does work for charities when she is available. Churches and other charities may be eligible for a reduced rate on days that are open for work. It's best to schedule a weeknight to increase your chance of availability. 

					◼︎ What about events outside of Lincoln 
						: We do travel outside of lincoln but we do also charge the current IRS milage rates for any event outside of a 15 mile radius of the city limits.
