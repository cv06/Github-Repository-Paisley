							◼︎ In the days of hair bands and leg warmers, a teenager named Liz learned the art of clowning for a missions trip to Arizona. A clown named Half Note was born and then put on the shelf for a couple of decades. In 2017 she had the opportunity to make balloons for a church event in the Havelock area of Lincoln NE. The fabulous Tammy from Butterfly Kisses face painting then introduced her to several people in the industry, and Teresa AKA Shades The Clown taught Liz all kinds of fantastic balloon tricks. Paisley Poppins became a reality on May 4th 2018 (Star Wars Day), and she has loved working with balloons and parties ever since.
							> she particularly loves the chance to work with people who she can tell about the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
